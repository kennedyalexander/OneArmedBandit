# Objects

Incoming requests from a user are handled in a UserRequest this allows you to almost always expect the same data
UserRequest
-> username String its a unique ID in my system
-> userToken Given on login enables you to see what has gone on in this session not used for much yet and so will be auto filled for now.

Incoming Login requests are special and so have their own object
